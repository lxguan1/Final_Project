Reading PLINK BED file from [plink_files_GBR/chr2_cm.bed] in SNP-major format ...
Genotype data for 88 individuals and 3292764 SNPs to be included from [plink_files_GBR/chr2_cm.bed].
Calculating allele frequencies ...
Filtering SNPs with MAF > 1e-05 ...
After filtering SNPs with MAF > 1e-05, there are 1008251 SNPs (2284513 SNPs with MAF < 1e-05).

Calculating LD score for SNPs (block size of 1000Kb with an overlap of 500Kb between blocks); LD rsq threshold = 0) ... 
LD rsq will be adjusted for chance correlation, i.e. rsq_adj = rsq - (1 - rsq) / (n -2).
LD score for 1008251 SNPs have been saved in the file [gcta_output_1000_GBR/chr2.score.ld].
