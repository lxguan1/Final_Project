Reading PLINK BED file from [plink_files_TSI/chr21_cm.bed] in SNP-major format ...
Genotype data for 98 individuals and 515536 SNPs to be included from [plink_files_TSI/chr21_cm.bed].
Calculating allele frequencies ...
Filtering SNPs with MAF > 1e-05 ...
After filtering SNPs with MAF > 1e-05, there are 175770 SNPs (339766 SNPs with MAF < 1e-05).

Calculating LD score for SNPs (block size of 1000Kb with an overlap of 500Kb between blocks); LD rsq threshold = 0) ... 
LD rsq will be adjusted for chance correlation, i.e. rsq_adj = rsq - (1 - rsq) / (n -2).
LD score for 175770 SNPs have been saved in the file [gcta_output_1000_TSI/chr21.score.ld].
