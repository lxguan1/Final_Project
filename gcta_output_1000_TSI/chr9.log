Reading PLINK BED file from [plink_files_TSI/chr9_cm.bed] in SNP-major format ...
Genotype data for 98 individuals and 1645331 SNPs to be included from [plink_files_TSI/chr9_cm.bed].
Calculating allele frequencies ...
Filtering SNPs with MAF > 1e-05 ...
After filtering SNPs with MAF > 1e-05, there are 545056 SNPs (1100275 SNPs with MAF < 1e-05).

Calculating LD score for SNPs (block size of 1000Kb with an overlap of 500Kb between blocks); LD rsq threshold = 0) ... 
LD rsq will be adjusted for chance correlation, i.e. rsq_adj = rsq - (1 - rsq) / (n -2).
LD score for 545056 SNPs have been saved in the file [gcta_output_1000_TSI/chr9.score.ld].
