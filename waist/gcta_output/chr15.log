Reading PLINK BED file from [../waist/plink_files/chr15_cm.bed] in SNP-major format ...
Genotype data for 378 individuals and 32901 SNPs to be included from [../waist/plink_files/chr15_cm.bed].
Calculating allele frequencies ...
Filtering SNPs with MAF > 1e-05 ...
After filtering SNPs with MAF > 1e-05, there are 32901 SNPs (0 SNPs with MAF < 1e-05).

Calculating LD score for SNPs (block size of 1000Kb with an overlap of 500Kb between blocks); LD rsq threshold = 0) ... 
LD rsq will be adjusted for chance correlation, i.e. rsq_adj = rsq - (1 - rsq) / (n -2).
LD score for 32901 SNPs have been saved in the file [../waist/gcta_output/chr15.score.ld].
